                        EchoDuo is an autonomous, multi-agent AI podcast system that doesn't just generate content — it thinks, acts, evolves, and publishes on its own.

                        Unlike traditional AI tools that require constant human prompts and editing, EchoDuo operates as a coordinated network of intelligent agents:

                        One agent identifies what information is needed

                        Another agent retrieves real-world data from the internet

                        Another agent writes a human-like conversation

                        A memory system ensures evolution over time

                        A voice engine turns text into real audio

                        A publishing system stores and organizes every episode

                        Every episode is a natural conversation between two distinct personas, Alex (curious & empathetic) and Maya (analytical & grounded), designed to reflect how real people explore complex topics together.

                        EchoDuo also integrates sponsors seamlessly and organically, embedding them as lived experiences or practical tools — never as disruptive ads.

                        At its core, EchoDuo is a demonstration of what happens when AI stops being a tool and starts becoming a living, learning system.
